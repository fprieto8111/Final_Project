**Wikipedia Condenser Project
**
Use Case: Ease and speed up the creation of a summary that condenses Wikipedia pages abstracts based on a query a user manually writes. The query will define the scope of the summary, which will take into consideration the links to other Wikipedia pages in the abstract. The MVP will be the code to generate the summary of Wikipedia pages, nice to have will be the UI. Ideally a chatbot will be created to make the generation of the summary more interactive, otherwise a web UI will be created.
